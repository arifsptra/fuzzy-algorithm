# Fuzzy Algorithm with Mamdani Method
This is a repository for fuzzy algorithm programs with the Mamdani method developed using JavaScript, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, and FontAwesome to create interactive website displays.

## Description
This program implements a fuzzy algorithm with the Mamdani method to make inferences and produce output based on the input given. Mamdani's fuzzy algorithm is an approach in fuzzy logic theory that uses fuzzy rules to transform input into fuzzy output. This program allows the user to enter input values, select fuzzy rules, perform fuzzification, inference using fuzzy rules, and defuzzification to produce the desired output.

## Technology Used
- HTML: Used to build the structure of web pages.
- CSS and Tailwind CSS: Used to set the layout and appearance of HTML elements.
- JavaScript: Used for program logic and interaction with HTML elements.
- Chart.js: Used to create visualization charts of output results.
- FontAwesome: Used to provide icons used in the appearance of the website.
